# Northcoders News API

## Set-up

To get started with this API you must first create the necessary environment variables.

- First create 2 files one named `.env.test` and another named `.env.development`.
- Second populate these files with `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test` for test and `PGDATABASE=nc_news` for development (Reference .env-example for structure).

This will allow you to test the functionality of the API with a much smaller database saving you time.
